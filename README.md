# Summary

This project was created before I discovered `cloc`. It does, however, provide some additional insights such as the number of storyboards and xibs that `cloc` does not. Currently a work in progress.

# Usage

`ioscodemetrics.sh someDirectory [someDirectory2 ...]`

> Note: you may need to `chmod u+x ioscodemetrics.sh` if you run into permission-related issues
